# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your portfolio to Vercel in just a few steps.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account

## 🎯 Quick Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it `pravin-dev-portfolio` (or any name you prefer)
   - Make it public or private (your choice)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   # Add all files to Git
   git add .
   
   # Commit your changes
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Portfolio ready for deployment"
   
   # Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with your repo URL)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pravin-dev-portfolio.git
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

## ✅ What's Already Configured

Your project is already optimized for Vercel deployment:

## 🔧 Custom Domain (Optional)

To add a custom domain:
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click "Settings" → "Domains"
3. Add your domain (e.g., `pravin.dev` or `portfolio.yourdomain.com`)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Build fails?

- Ensure `npm run build` works locally
- Check Vercel build logs for specific errors

### PDF not downloading?
- Verify `Pravin-N-Full-Stack-Developer.pdf` is in the `public` folder
- Check that the file is committed to Git
- Ensure the file path in `Hero.tsx` matches exactly

### Routing issues?
- The `vercel.json` includes SPA fallback configuration
- All routes should redirect to `index.html`

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, your portfolio will be live and accessible to the world! Share your Vercel URL with potential employers, clients, and on your social media profiles.
